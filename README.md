# ask-audio-auth

This is an experimental project aimed at exploring alternative authentication methods for the Alexa Skill platform.

In this project, we focus on `Crypto-Phonic Authentication` i.e. authentication via cryptographically generated sounds.

## Concept

Given the following:

- there is a range of sound inaudible to humans but discernable by common electronics e.g. smart phones and smart home devices
- we can programmatically generate those inaudible sounds
- those sounds can be cryptographically fingerprinted and are unique
